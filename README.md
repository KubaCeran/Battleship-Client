# Battleship-Client

This project uses Angular 14, Boostrap 5.2 and Font Awesome 4.7.

## Frontend

Frontend for Battleship-API (https://github.com/KubaCeran/Battleship-API). 

An angular application that contains 3 components - navbar, rules page to show the rules, and new game that starts a new game between bots. The new game tab contains two buttons: reset, which resets the game and displays the new board for both players, and move, which displays the board with updated fields. Depending on which player first hits all the fields with ships - it is displayed who won and the "move" button is deactivated.
